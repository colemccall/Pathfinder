## Abstract

The purpose of this project was to examine all possible solutions to finding a path on a map, while only knowing the map, the starting point, and the end point. A variety of algorithms and searches were implemented to find and compare possible solutions from the starting point to the end point. These searches include a breadth-first search, uniform cost search, iterative deepening, and three heuristics (Manhattan, Euclidean, and Greedy). Each algorithm was written using C++ and the solutions generated by each algorithm were compared in terms of movement cost, distance, and time. All searches except for the uniform cost search resulted in the minimum number of moves (distance) but did not result in the lowest cost. No search was able to find the optimal path, but the Manhattan and Greedy searches found the lowest cost path, also in the lowest amount of time. The breadth-first search was found to be slowest and least efficient in terms of time and movement cost. Optimizations and improvements are possible, as well as adding twists or variations to the problem to better test the algorithms.


## Project Overview

This project attempts to tackle the pathfinding problem. This is a scenario in which a starting point (A) and end point (B) are known, as well as the map that these points are on. The pathfinding problem takes this scenario and tries to find a path from the starting point to the ending point – essentially going from Point A to Point B. This problem is solved by using artificial intelligence to find possible paths from the starting point to the end point. These paths are then compared using multiple metrics, the most noticeable being time (in seconds), cost (movement cost based on the type of tile), and distance (number of moves). 

While this problem can be solved in a variety of ways, the simplest and most effective solution started with creating the map. The map was divided up into a 15 by 20 grid, with each square containing a “tile” that holds an x-coordinate, y-coordinate, land type and land cost. Each tile also contained information concerning the four neighbors in each cardinal direction around it. From here, search algorithms could be conducted to find a path from the start to the end, while also counting the number of moves and the cost of each move.
